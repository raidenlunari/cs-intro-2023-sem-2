        Activity 1: Computing Innovation
    </h2>
    <h3>
        1. Summarize how your topic is a computational innovation and provide details.
    </h3>
    <p>
        VPNs use computational components when using tunneling to help one reach the internet while hiding searches from your ISP. This can help a user access websites which would normally be blocked and hide their data from a tracker or the network owner’s eyes. VPNs require computational components like the existence of a computer, coding the connections to servers and tunneling methods, and the parts of it like cryptography and hashing. By using servers owned by the company as a middleman for your searches or activity instead of leaving it open, it’s more difficult for an entity to track down who it is doing the activity. As such, because of all the data, computing, and such entities and tools, VPNs can be counted as a type of computing innovation.

        Activity 2: Analyzing Data for Computing Innovations
    </h2>
    <h3>
        1. Identifies the data that the identified or described computing innovation uses AND Explains how that data is consumed, produced, OR transformed.
    </h3>
    <p>
        Depending on the VPN, components used to deliver the service can include cryptography, hashing, encryption, etc. (Charlotte Empey, https://www.avast.com/c-what-is-a-vpn) VPNs use either symmetric cryptography or asymmetric cryptography, also depending on the VPN and the purpose or usage. Cryptography turns a message or a command into a different string or file by encrypting it, and a key is required to be able to decrypt it at the end server and receive the starting command. Hashing turns a key or string of characters into a different string or value (Andrew Zola, https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/hashing), helping you protect your data and information. Encryption turns your message from “plaintext” to “ciphertext”, which helps protect your data by preventing unauthorized users from being able to decrypt it.

    </p>
    <h3>
        2. Identify one data storage, data privacy, OR data security concern related to the identified or described computing innovation.
    </h3>
    <p>
        VPNs are used to help keep users’ data private and prevent them and their data from being seen, and also protecting their computer from being hacked using the internet or monitored (https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-a-vpn). Without a VPN, a hacker through the internet could look into your computer or hack into it using holes in unsecure networks. VPNs also prevent your ISP from seeing your data, allowing you to access websites and domains which would be unavailable in your country. For privacy reasons, VPNs can also prevent ISPs or internet providers from seeing what you’re doing on your computer, which allows for even greater security.

        Activity 3: Analyzing Impact of Computing Innovation
    </h2>
    <h3>
        1. States a fact about the correctly identified computing innovation’s intended purpose OR function.
    </h3>
    <p>
        VPNs are made to hide data from ISPs, nations, and hackers, prevent trackers from websites or external forces, and allow viewing of prohibited content. As explained above, ISPs, nations, and hackers can all look at one’s data and what one is accessing, and VPNs help tunnel your data, blocking it from visibility. Trackers through wifi or your ISP can also be blocked by a VPN, as these trackers also cannot pass through the encryption and tunneling. Domains like YouTube, Google, and Discord are blocked in authoritarian regimes like China, but with a VPN, these nations cannot access your data either and you can look at these websites.
    </p>
    <h3>
        2. Identifies at least ONE effect of the identified or described computing innovation.
    </h3>
    <p>
        VPNs can help allow for less censorship, more privacy, and more safety. In these authoritarian regimes, there’s less transparency because of bans in the media, social media, and other websites, and VPNs can help give more transparency and less censorship by blocking these bans. Dangerous wifi networks can be used by hackers to access and get into one’s computer, but a VPN shields one from such threats. Data privacy is a major concern for many people who don’t want their activity to be seen, so VPNs can certainly help achieve that goal.

    </p>
    <h3>
        3. Identifies a beneficial effect of the identified or described computing innovation AND identifies a harmful effect of the identified or described computing innovation.
    </h3>
    <p>
        VPNs can allow people to have a more global view and see things they would be censored from, like news disagreeing with the regime, social media blocked in the country, and conversations which don’t agree with what the government wants the people to believe. (https://mobiuspay.com/blog/global-vpn-use-is-booming-but-so-is-cyber-censorship.story) This allows people to have a broader amount of resources to deduce their own truths from, and know more about the world. However, VPNs can make it harder for people like the authorities or government agencies from seeing dangerous activity like terrorist attacks, criminal movement, illegal trafficking, et cetera, which slows down legal actions and can make it more unsafe for people who would be affected by these groups. For example, it was harder for Romanian authorities to track the movements and location of Andrew Tate, an alleged human trafficker hiding in the country, when he used a VPN.

    <h3>
        4. Explains how ONE of the identified effects relates to society, economy, or culture.
    </h3>
    <p>
        The internet allows people to be connected easier and access more information, which makes governments fear it. If certain governments were to have no bans on this information, the people could have more information on the actions of the government internationally, which would be bad for the regime. As such, these governments try to censor news, opinions, etc. to protect their interests. VPNs allow people to have more transparency and global viewpoints..
